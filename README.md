# NER-from-Legal-Documents

Legal documents are in many varieties and it is a heavy task for big businesses to go through and analyse all the currently active legal documents for various company requirements. Sometimes it can be validity checks of the contracts or at some other times the check for conflicts in policies of the company with contract made with some other companies or even individuals. 
Named-Entity Recognition from legal documents is intended to make this process easier by developing an automation system that can analyse and extract information from a document. 

The general purpose entities present in contracts are used to extract specific legal concepts like Effective Date, Execution Date, Employee Name, Term Period, etc. 
Extracting this information from contracts allows users to manage and search through their contracts with ease.

Extracting the main entities in a text also helps to sort unstructured data and detect important information, which is crucial if you have to deal with large datasets.
