# NER-from-Legal-Documents

The main objective of this project is to extract custom name entities from legal documents.
The general purpose entities present in contracts are used to extract specific legal concepts like Effective Date, Execution Date, Employee Name, Term Period, etc. Extracting this information from contracts allows users to manage and search through their contracts with ease.
Extracting the main entities in a text also helps to sort unstructured data and detect important information, which is crucial if you have to deal with large datasets.
